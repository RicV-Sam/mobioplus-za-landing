            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p>Welcome to MOBIO+. By using our service, you agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
            <p>MOBIO+ is a subscription-based digital content service providing access to astronomy content, games, and 360-degree experiences. This service is available to Vodacom South Africa subscribers.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Subscription and Billing</h2>
            <p>New subscribers are entitled to a free trial for the first 24 hours. Following the trial period, the service is billed at R15 per day (VAT included). Charges will be deducted from your Vodacom mobile account. The subscription automatically renews daily until you unsubscribe.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Unsubscribing</h2>
            <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time. To unsubscribe, dial *135*997# from your Vodacom mobile or use the My Vodacom App to manage your active subscriptions. You will continue to have access until the end of the current billing period.</p>

            <h2>4. Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>Once a daily subscription fee is billed, it is non-refundable as access to the premium content is immediately granted. You may cancel at any time to prevent future charges.</p>
